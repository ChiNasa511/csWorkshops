## Future Faculty Workshops

A lot of schools have their own summer/winter future faculty programs tailored for their own students. For example, Cornell has their Future Professos Institute (http://blogs.cornell.edu/futureprofs/) but registration for non-Cornell students is $45. Be sure to check if your institution has a similar program, I know there are others at Berkeley, Stanford, etc.
